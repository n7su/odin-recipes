        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When pizza flavors meet the comfort of a hearty casserole, the result is pure culinary bliss—introducing our Pizza-Inspired Rice Bake. This recipe blends the iconic taste of pizza with the warmth and heartiness of a baked rice dish.</p>
        <p>Using par-boiled long-grain rice ensures a fluffy texture with perfectly separated grains, ideal for soaking up the rich marinara broth without becoming mushy. A sprinkle of Parmesan adds a creamy depth, while the bubbly mozzarella and crispy pepperoni on top bring all the classic pizza vibes to life.</p>
        <p>The final dish? A flavorful, saucy bake that’s satisfying, indulgent, and, as some taste-testers claim, “even better than pizza!”</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked parboiled long-grain white rice</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups vegetable or chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups marinara sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>15 pepperoni slices</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Torn fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all Ingredients. Spray an 8-inch broiler-safe baking dish with cooking spray, and set aside. </li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and crushed red pepper and cook, stirring often, until garlic is lightly browned and aromatic, about 1 minute. Add rice, and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly toasted, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in stock, salt, pepper, and 1 1/2 cups marinara sauce. Bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, covered, stirring every few minutes, until rice is almost fully cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, stir in Parmesan cheese and remaining 1/2 cup marinara, until evenly combined. </li>
            <li>Transfer rice mixture to the prepared baking dish, spreading it into an even layer.</li>
            <li>Top evenly with pepperoni and mozzarella. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. With baking dish still in the oven, increase oven temperature to broil; broil until cheese is just golden brown, 2 to 5 more minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and garnish with basil. </li>
        </ol>
